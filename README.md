# T-UI Linux CLI Launcher (Modern Fork)

> **Note:** This is a **fork** of the original T-UI Launcher by Francesco Andreuzzi. The original project is outdated and no longer maintained.

## About this Fork
I really wanted to run a CLI launcher on my modern device, but the original T-UI hasn't been updated in years and is unstable on newer Android versions (Android 14+).

**My goal is simple:** Make it run and be usable on modern Android devices.

## 🆘 Help Wanted (I hate Java)
I am actively looking for contributors to help maintain and modernize this codebase.

**Full disclosure:** I absolutely **detest** Java. My background is in **C** and **Rust**, and I work much faster and happier in those languages. Working with Java is a struggle for me, which makes my progress significantly slower than it could be.

If you know Java/Android development and want to help keep this launcher alive, **please send Pull Requests**. If you want to help rewrite components or optimize the code, your help is even more welcome.
